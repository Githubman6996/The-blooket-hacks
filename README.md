  <h3> I want to clear this up. There has been a lot of drama or whatever going around about "he stole my hacks" and "no you stole mine". Yes, I copied peoples and put them here. I intended to make a compilation, not take credit for things I didn't do. Yes, I will be working on this repo again, but this time I will have full permission or if the license allows me to compile them. Thanks, -Hankypoo7

  <h2>Possibilities of scripts</h2>
  
```
I have have seen a lot of people talk about how someone should make something that is more than adding 500+ tokens.
We can not do that due to the Blooket API.
The token limit is defined by the API, meaning adding 501 tokens would just ban your account.
There are some things you can't change without owning that website or having access to the database of the website.
A couple more examples of impossible scripts are changing box costs and adding all Blooks permanently.
Please keep this in mind before asking for a script.
