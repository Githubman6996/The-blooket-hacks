  <h2>Possibilities of scripts</h2>
  
```
I have have seen a lot of people talk about how someone should make something that is more than adding 500+ tokens.
We can not do that due to the Blooket API.
The token limit is defined by the API, meaning adding 501 tokens would just ban your account.
There are some things you can't change without owning that website or having access to the database of the website.
A couple more examples of impossible scripts are changing box costs and adding all Blooks permanently.
Please keep this in mind before asking for a script.
