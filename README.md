  <h3>I want to clear this up. There has been a lot of drama or whatever going around about "he stole my hacks" and "no, you stole mine." Yes, I copied other people's hacks and compiled them here. I intended to make a compilation, not take credit for things I didn't do. In the future, I will ensure I have full permission or compile only if the license allows me to. Thanks, -Hankypoo7</h3>

  <h2>Possibilities of scripts</h2>
  <pre>
    <code>
I have seen a lot of people talk about how someone should make something more than adding 500+ tokens.
We cannot do that due to the Blooket API.
The token limit is defined by the API, meaning adding 501 tokens would just ban your account.
There are some things you can't change without owning the website or having access to its database.
A couple more examples of impossible scripts are changing box costs and adding all Blooks permanently.
Please keep this in mind before asking for a script.
